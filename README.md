# css-test
In this project, I've included an HTML file with (almost) all the elements, for testing purposes. 

The goal is to be able to include all types of data, small and big images, short and long paragraphs, small and large tables, etc. 

Idea: Organize CSS by dividing HTML in levels, where first level is that where block elements decide the layout of the page. Then, the other levels will be each of these block elements.
